# Present Perfect Progressive

### Rules and Explanations

_Subject + has/have (not) + been + - ing_\


Use:

* began in the past
* in progress right now
* how long (duration)

### Examples

> She has been dancing for five hours!

***

:warning: Be aware of using non-action (_state_) verbs such as “know”! They turn a sentence to the present perfect form: I have known my best friend for 10 years.
