# Phrasal Verbs

### Rules and Explanations

Phrasal verbs are a combination of a verb and one or more particles (prepositions or adverbs) that, together, create a meaning different from the original verb alone. These combinations often have idiomatic meanings that may not be obvious from the individual words.

Structure of Phrasal Verbs:

1. Verb + Preposition (e.g., look after, run into)
2. Verb + Adverb (e.g., give up, take off)
3. Verb + Adverb + Preposition (e.g., put up with, get along with)
