# Adjective Clauses with Subject vs Object Pronouns

### Rules and Explanations

Subject pronouns (who, which, that) are used when the relative pronoun refers to the subject of the verb in the adjective clause. You cannot omit the subject pronoun.

Object pronouns (whom, which, that) are used when the relative pronoun refers to the object of the verb or preposition. You can omit the object pronoun in informal English.
